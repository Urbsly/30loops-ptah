30Loops documentation:

To deploy this app on 30Loops, do the following (assuming you already
have an account with 30Loops, and have set up your .thirty.cfg file):

$ mkdir newapp
$ cd newapp
$ virtualenv venv --distribute --no-site-packages
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install thirty-cli
$ thirty create app ptahapp git://github.com/Urbsly/30loops-ptah.git --flavor wsgi --root urbsly --wsgi-entrypoint runapp:app
$ thirty deploy ptahapp

Ideally, you would have forked the repository first, and so used your
fork in step six instead.

To run this code locally, do the following:

$ git clone git://github.com/Urbsly/30loops-ptah.git
$ cd 30loops-ptah
$ pip install -r localrequirements.txt
$ python setup.py develop
$ ../venv/bin/pserve settings.ini --reload

Changes made to this skeleton from the default ptah_starter:

1. runapp.py added to provide the WSGI entrypoint

2. requirements.txt informs 30Loops what the dependencies are. Dependencies
   added from the stock ptah_starter are psycopg2. These haven't
   been added to localrequirements.txt.

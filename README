To deploy this app on Heroku, do the following:

Install Heroku Toolbelt: https://toolbelt.herokuapp.com/

$ mkdir newapp
$ cd newapp
$ virtualenv venv --distribute --no-site-packages
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ git clone git://github.com/Urbsly/heroku-ptah.git
$ cd heroku-ptah
$ heroku create --stack cedar
$ heroku addons:add shared-database
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku ps:scale web=1
$ heroku open

Ideally, you would have forked the repository first, and so checked out a
writible clone in step five instead of a read-only copy.

Note: this code won't run on your local machine as is. A bit more cleanup is
still needed.

Changes made to this skeleton from the default ptah_starter:

1. Procfile added to tell Heroku what to run upon deployment to start the web
   service.

2. run bash script that causes Heroku to develop then run the app.

3. runapp.py that actually runs the app under waitress.

4. requirements.txt informs Heroku what the dependencies are. Dependencies
   added from the stock ptah_starter are waitress and psycopg2.

5. Heroku doesn't support SQLite, so a small change was required to get Ptah
   to work with the shared postgres db that Heroku provisions. Heroku provides
   the DB connection string as the environment variable DATABASE_URL (if the
   database is a shared database, it is also available as SHARED_DATABASE_URL).
   app.py has been modified to use this string to override the sqlalchemy.url
   parameter from settings.ini before the settings are applied.
